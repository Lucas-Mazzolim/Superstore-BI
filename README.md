# Superstore-BI

Project where I prepared a data source for querying and we created a BI visualization in Data Studio. I used a Kaggle dataset about a general store to gain a global view of operations, which helps in making important decisions by providing a better understanding of the business. The original dataset came in a CSV file, from which I carried out an ETL process to the MySQL database, designed and implemented to receive it (fully normalized). The final data query to the viewer was made from Google Spreadsheet, allowing for a continuously updated visualization as the spreadsheet is modified.
